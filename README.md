# Delivery-Service
Courier service providers have a very large network across countries. A courier goes through several places including distribution center. 

All customers would like to track their consignment online. Customer can track his/her order, till where the courier has been reached just by logging in and entering courier number to track the location of the package. 

Here we propose a dedicated courier tracking system where customer may check the status and location of his/her courier. Here every distribution channel terminal has a system operated by authorized people at that particular point of distribution. On logging, the person needs to make an entry of a package number that should be reaching to him/her. This data is directly uploaded to the main system that now keeps track of latest location and status of the package through an active internet connection. The data stored on server can now be used for live package status tracking by customers. Customers may login in to the server in order to enter their unique courier tracking number. On entering the number system, they get the last recorded status of that particular package and shows this data to the user. The user may now track his package as and when needed. 

The courier tracking system can be further improved by adding a barcode to every package so that every point just needs to scan the barcode instead of doing a manual entry of package number.
